  summary: Seal a document with a legal entity signature
  description: >-
    Uploading and affixing an electronic seal to a document takes just one call using the /v2/seal resource.
    The JSON is similar to the SignatureRequest. It requires only the PDF document as a Base64 encoded string in the content field.
    Additionally, you can place a visual signature on the document, as described in the Visual Signatures chapter of the Skribble API documentation, but this is optional.
    An API response from a seal request contains a document_id of the newly created document with the seal.
    Use the GET /v2/documents resource to retrieve the document with the electronic seal or reuse it in further signature requests, such as for personal electronic signatures.
