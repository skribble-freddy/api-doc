  summary: Delete document
  description: |
    Deleting a `Document` is similar to deleting a `SignatureRequest`.  

    That means, deleting a `Document`  does not necessarily remove the a
    `Document` from the system.  


    If there is MORE than one participant involved, then the DELETE request will
    only remove the current user from the `Document`.   


    Only when the last user deletes the `Document` using the Skribble web
    application, the system  will finally remove the object.
