  summary: Get signature qualities details for a user
  description: >-
    The result of this query will tell you what final signature quality will be
    used for the given user username to sign a document.  

    The resulting signature quality is determined in combination of the
    requested quality and legislation, whereas any stands for any legislation.  

    Description for the example request:  

    If you create a SignatureRequest with quality=AES_MINIMAL and the
    legislation=ZERTES the user in this example would finally sign the document
    with the signature quality QES.  

    As described in the previous chapter AES_MINIMAL will use QES as long as the
    user settings allow this.
