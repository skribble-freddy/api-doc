  summary: Get callbacks detals for a signature request
  description: >-
    In certain scenarios, it is beneficial to view and verify the status of
    callbacks for a `SignatureRequest`. For example, you might want to confirm
    whether a callback has already been executed or to identify any errors that
    occurred during the callback process.


    This endpoint provides the capability to obtain detailed information about
    the callbacks associated with a `SignatureRequest`, enabling comprehensive
    monitoring and troubleshooting. By using this endpoint, you can ensure the
    reliability and accuracy of your callback operations and quickly address any
    issues that may arise.


    **Result**


    If no callback has been called yet, the response will be an empty array.
    Otherwise it will contain an array of `callback` objects that were already
    executed.
