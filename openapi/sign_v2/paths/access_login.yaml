    In order to use the API of Skribble, you first need to obtain an API key
    with an API user. Both can be accessed inside the API key page inside your
    business profile. From here, you can create and manage your API keys.
    Consult our [guide](https://docs.skribble.com/business-admin/api/apicreate.html) for help.


    Skribble offers two types of API keys:


    **Demo API keys**  

    Demo API keys are for testing and development purposes.
    Signatures requested by such keys don't have any legal weight and are free
    of charge.

    You can recognize these keys by their name, which start with **api_demo**.  
    
    
    **Production API keys**  

    Production API keys are used for live systems.
    Signatures requested by such keys will be invoiced.  

    You can recognize these keys by their name, which usually starts with
    **api_production** or in some rare cases just with **api_prod**.

    > **⚠ Note**  
    All costs of signature requests created with your API keys will be
    **charged to your business**! 
          
    We recommend you to **start with a demo API key for development and
    testing** and switch to the production API key as soon as you are finished
    with testing.

    If you have problems setting up Skribble Business, just drop us an e-mail
    at [info@skribble.com](mailto:info@skribble.com).


    To obtain an access token, log in using the `/access/login` resource.

    You can pass your login data using raw JSON or alternatively as
    `x-www-form-urlencoded` `key:value` pairs (see example requests).

    Upon a successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) will be returned.  
    The JWT MUST be included in nearly every request made to the API.


    The access token is transported in an HTTP header called `Authorization`.

    The content of the header starts with `Bearer` followed by the JWT string.
    Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...`

    ### Token Life Cycle

    #### API-Key

    The API key has a long, but not an unlimited lifetime.  
    The validity period depends on the volume of API calls and is discussed individually as part of the shared secret agreement.

    #### Access Token

    The access token has a lifetime of about **20 minutes**.  
    Currently, we do not renew the access token automatically. Planned for future releases.

    #### Logout

    There is **no logout**. The access token will expire after the defined time.
