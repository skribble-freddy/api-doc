  summary: Delete Send-To
  description: |
    To call the `delete` endpoint, you must include the value of the
    `access_code` field—received when creating the `Send-To` object—in the
    request header `X-Accesscode`.

    This call deletes the involved `Send-To`, `Document`, and `SignatureRequest`
    objects regardless of the current `Send-To` state.
