  summary: Get Signature Request Report
  description: |-
    Provides the signature report for a specific signature request.

    By default, the report is returned as a human-readable, digitally signed
    PDF document. Optionally, the report format can be changed using the
    `type` query parameter (e.g. JSON or HTML).

    The report contains all relevant information about the signature process,
    including signatories, timestamps, and verification details. It serves as
    legally valid proof of the completed signing process and can be stored or
    shared for auditing, compliance, or record-keeping purposes.
