  title: Skribble API v2
  version: 2.1.0
  description: >-
    The Skribble API v2 documentation describes the publicly available Skribble
    API version 2. The API allows businesses and teams of any size to integrate
    the e-signing solution of Skribble with internal systems, software, or SaaS
    solutions. It provides a simple interface to create and manage signature
    requests programmatically. Signature requests define who signs what and
    describe the document flow between participants. Actual signing occurs in
    the Skribble web application.

    To get started, set up Skribble Business. Feedback and questions can be sent
    to the Google Group public-api-users@skribble.com.

    API v2 provides enhanced features including creating, finding, and
    triggering signature requests, user and monitoring details, and reporting
    activities. It maintains backward compatibility with API v1 but upgrading is
    recommended to access the latest features. Migration from API v1 involves
    updating base URLs, renaming fields, and adjusting visual signature
    positions.
