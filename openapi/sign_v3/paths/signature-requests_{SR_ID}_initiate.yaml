  summary: Invite signers and start signing process
  description: |-
    To start the signing process as usual, simply call the initiate endpoint.

    This action sends out the invitation emails and changes the status_overall from `DRAFT` to `OPEN`.
  
    As a result, the `SignatureRequest` will no longer appear in the Drafts section. Instead, users 
    will find it in the appropriate section, such as Pending.
