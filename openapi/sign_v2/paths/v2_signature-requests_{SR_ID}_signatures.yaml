  summary: Add an individual signer
  description: >-
    To add an individual signer, use the same parameters as when creating a
    SignatureRequest. The process is the same. By using `account_email`, you can
    add a signer who has a Skribble account. By using `signer_identity_data`,
    you can invite a No-Account-Signer to the SignatureRequest with the ID
    `{{SR_ID}}`.


    > 💡 Good to know  

    We recommend this approach of combining `signer_idendity_data` and
    `account_email` if you are unsure whether the user has a Skribble account.
    The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the
    SignatureRequest in the **To sign** section of their account on
    my.skribble.com.  

    Conversely, if you invite them using only `signer_identity_data`, the
    document will not appear in their Skribble account, even if they have an
    existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to access the document
    using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email.
