  summary: Get the list of callbacks for a signature request
  description: >-
    In certain scenarios, it is beneficial to view and verify the status of
    callbacks for a `SignatureRequest`. For example, you might want to confirm
    whether a callback has already been executed or to identify any errors that
    occurred during the callback process.


    This endpoint provides the capability to obtain detailed information about
    the callbacks associated with a `SignatureRequest`, enabling comprehensive
    monitoring and troubleshooting. By using this endpoint, you can ensure the
    reliability and accuracy of your callback operations and quickly address any
    issues that may arise.


    **Result**


    If no callback has been called yet, the response will be an empty array.
    Otherwise it will contain an array of `callback` objects that were already
    executed.


    The fields description of the single callback object:


    | **Fieldname** | **Description** |

    | --- | --- |

    | `signature_request_id` | The ID of the parent `SignatureRequest` object. |

    | `url` | The given URL to which the callback request will be sent. |

    | `type` | The type of the event the callback is executed on. This field can
    have the value `SUCCESS`, `UPDATE` or `ERROR` based on the given
    `SignatureRequest` fields `callback_success_url`, `callback_update_url` and
    `callback_error_url` |

    | `state` | The state of the callback. This field can be:  <br>`OPEN` - The
    callback request will be executed in the next execution cycle. 
    <br>`COMPLETED` - The callback request was executed successfully. The API
    received an HTTP 2xx success code in response.  <br>`RESIGNATED` - The
    callback request has been attempted `attempts` times but was unsuccessful.
    The API did not receive a valid HTTP 2xx response. |

    | `attempts` | The amount of times the callback request was executed. |

    | `messages` | An array of messages containing the HTTP response message in
    case that the API did not receive a HTTP 2xx success code. |
