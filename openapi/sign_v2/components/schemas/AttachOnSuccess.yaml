title: Attachment when signed
type: array
description: >-
  When a SignatureRequest has been signed by all signers, all signers and all observers are notified by email.
  Skribble provides the option to attach two types of attachments automatically to this email:
    - the signed document and
    - the signature protocol.

  This can be configured via the business settings, which can be used to define that these documents should generally
  be attached for all SignatureRequests created by business members.

  Alternatively it is possible to define the attachments on demand per SignatureRequest by using this field.
items:
  type: string
  enum:
    - SIGNED_DOCUMENT
    - SIGNATURE_PROTOCOL
example:
  - SIGNED_DOCUMENT
  - SIGNATURE_PROTOCOL
