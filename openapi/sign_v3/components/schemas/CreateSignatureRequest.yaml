          It is possible to create a SignatureRequest where one or more invited participants won't need a 
          Skribble account to sign the SignatureRequest. Those signers are called No-Account-Signers (NAS).
 
          To create a SignatureRequest for a user without an account, omit the signatures array entry for
          this user and provide the necessary data using the `signer_identity_data` element instead.

          Each entry in the signatures array will be treated as a distinct identity. This means two entries 
          with the same `signer_identity_data` are treated as two different identities and require that this 
          person signs the document twice.

          Optionally you can combine `signer_identity_data` and account_email in your requests. In this case, 
          the system checks first if there is a Skribble account with the specified e-mail address. 
          If one is found the existing Skribble user will be invited to sign the document. Otherwise, the 
          specified user in `signer_identity_data` will be invited to sign.

          > Good to know
          We recommend this approach of combining `signer_identity_data` and `account_email` if you are unsure 
          whether the user has a Skribble account.
          The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the SignatureRequest in the 
          To sign section of their account on my.skribble.com.
          Conversely, if you invite them using only signer_identity_data, the document will not appear in
          their Skribble account, even if they have an existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to
          access the document using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email. 

          When the user visits the URL provided in the field `signing_url` inside the signature element, he
          will be forwarded to a special preview page of the PDF document and can start the signature process
          as usual.

          Missing fields like first name and last name can easily be adjusted by the signer through the
          Skribble web client.
