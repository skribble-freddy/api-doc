  summary: Delete a Signature Request
  description: |
    By using the signature request ID you can delete a `SignatureRequest`.  
     
    **Important:** A `SignatureRequest` can only be deleted using the API, if:

    1. the `SignatureRequest` is in the `status_overall=OPEN` and

    2. the API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, eg. when it
    was created by the API user. 
      
    Deleting a `SignatureRequest` does not necessarily remove the
    `SignatureRequest` from the system. 
     
    **WITHDRAWN**  

    When the API user is the **owner** of the `SignatureRequest` and the
    `SignatureRequest` is still in the `status_overall=OPEN` then the
    `SignatureRequest` will be **WITHDRAWN**.  

    This means that the `SignatureRequest` will get `status_overall=WITHDRAWN`
    and all the invited signatures will be marked with `status_code=WITHDRAWN`.
    Sign and read rights for the signers will be removed from the
    `SignatureRequest`, so that the invited signers can neither read nor sign
    the `SignatureRequest` any more. 


    **REMOVE AS PARTICIPANT**  

    When the API user is NOT the owner of the document but a participant of the
    `SignatureRequest`, then the `DELETE` request will only remove the current
    API user as participant from the signature request. 

    In this case the system will remove the objects the `SignatureRequest` and
    the related `document` as soon as the last remaining user deletes the
    `SignatureRequest` using the [Skribble web
    application](https://my.skribble.com) 


    **DELETING**  

    When the API user is the last user with access rights to the
    `SignatureRequest` e.g. after a **WITHDRAW** request, then the
    `SignatureRequest` and the related `document` will be completely removed
    from the system.
