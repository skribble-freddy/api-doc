  title: Skribble API v3
  version: 3.0.0
  description: |-
    The Skribble API v3 documentation describes the publicly available Skribble API version 3. The API allows businesses and teams of any size to integrate the e-signing solution of Skribble with internal systems, software, or SaaS solutions. It provides a simple interface to create and manage signature requests programmatically. Signature requests define who signs what and describe the document flow between participants. Actual signing occurs in the Skribble web application.
    To get started, set up Skribble Business. Feedback and questions can be sent to the Google Group public-api-users@skribble.com.
    API v3 provides enhanced features including creating, finding, and triggering signature requests, user and monitoring details, and reporting activities. It maintains backward compatibility with API v2 but upgrading is recommended to access the latest features. Migration from API v2 involves updating base URLs, renaming fields, and adjusting visual signature positions.

      In order to use the API of Skribble, you first need to obtain an API key with an API user. Both can be accessed inside the API key page inside your business profile. From here, you can create and manage your API keys. Consult our [guide](https://docs.skribble.com/business-admin/api/apicreate.html) for help.

      Skribble offers two types of API keys:

      **Demo API keys**  
      Demo API keys are for testing and development purposes.  
      You can recognize these keys by their name, which start with **api_demo**.  
      Signatures requested by such keys don't have any legal weight and are free of charge.

      **Production API keys**  
      Production API keys are used for live systems.  
      Signatures requested by such keys will be invoiced.  
      You can recognize these keys by their name, which usually starts with **api_production** or in some rare cases just with **api_prod**.

      > **⚠ Note**  
      All costs of signature requests created with your API keys will be **charged to your business**! 
        

      We recommend you to **start with a demo API key for development and testing** and switch to the production API key as soon as you are finished with testing.

      If you have problems setting up Skribble Business, just drop us an e-mail at

  - name: 1. Create a SignatureRequest
    description: |-
      The document workflow is quite easy.  
      You have one document and need one or more signatures. The document is private and not publicly available.

      We need to create a `SignatureRequest` object in Skribble. A `SignatureRequest` is a description telling Skribble, **who** is going to sign **what** and optionally how the signature should look like.

      So, let's start with the minimal information Skribble needs.

      1. Tell the user, **what will be signed**  
          The `title` should be short and treated like a file name. This field is mandatory.
          
      2. Tell Skribble **who will sign**  
          The `signatures` array contains all signers of the document.  
          In the example, we have 3 signers. They can sign in any sequence they want, and the signature position and appearance will be defined by the Skribble web application.  
          All participants are informed at the same time and are allowed to sign the document in any order. The system ensures that the document is nevertheless only changed sequentially.  
          The `account_email` contains the user's e-mail address. It has two functions. All notifications are sent to this e-mail address AND the e-mail is used to find the user's ID in our database.
          
      3. Tell Skribble **which document will be signed**  
          The `content` field contains the **Base64 encoded** bytes of the **PDF document**.  
          As an alternative to the `content`, you can give Skribble an URL using the field `file_url`, where it can download the document. The URL must not be used together with the content field.  
          All URLs passed to Skribble must use the HTTPS protocol.  
          `"file_url" : "https://myapp.com/path/to/document"`
          

      > Since we have a private document the recommended way is to transfer it to Skribble directly. 
        
      > The **maximum document size** is about **40 MB**, which results in the maximum request size of 60 MB. 
        

      You will find more details to the `SignatureRequest` in the chapter **Reference**.
  - name: 2. Redirect the user to the Skribble web application
    description: |-
      The user has to visit the [Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com) to actually sign the document.

      When we created a Signature Request, the user got notified by Skribble that there is a document waiting to be signed.

      Now we want to continue immediately and redirect the browser directly to Skribble showing the uploaded document.

      Skribble provides a `signing_url` inside the SignatureRequest.  
      The `signing_url` not only points to the [Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com), but will directly open the document for signing provided that the user is known to Skribble and is logged in. Otherwise, the user must login or register first to be able to see the document.

      There are some more options available to tailor the signing flow to your application's specific needs.

      #### Using redirections

      After successfully signing the document, the user will stay on the [Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com).

      However, you can add three different exit points as query parameters to the `signing_url`. Skribble will respect these parameters and redirect the user to the provided URLs once the signature process is finished.

      Using this, you can bring the user back from Skribble to your application.

      Make sure you encode your exit URLs properly. This is especially important for `GET` parameter separators like **?** and **&** to ensure that they are not interpreted by browsers as `GET` parameters on Skribble's web application itself.

      ##### Exit points

      | Parameter | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `exitURL` | URL to redirect the user to after the signature process finished. |
      | `errorURL` | URL to redirect the user to if any error occurs. Defaults to exitURL. Ignored if exitURL is not specified. |
      | `declineURL` | URL to redirect the user to if the user declines the signature request. Defaults to exitURL. Ignored if exitURL is not specified. |
      | `declineRedirect=true` (optional) | Use this in combination with `declineURL` to redirect directly to the specified `declineURL`. Skribble popups after the decline action will be skipped by this. |

      ##### Redirection timeout

      If `exitURL` is specified the user will be automatically redirected to the given URL after a successfull signature process. The default **redirection timeout is 45 seconds**.

      Using the URL parameter `redirectTimeout` this duration can be adjusted.

      Values equal or lower than 0 will cause the user to be redirected instantly, skipping Skribble's success page. For usability reasons the duration cannot be longer than 90 seconds. If a value higher than 90 is specified, the value will be set to 90.

      ##### Hide download button

      The success screen can be further simplified by hiding the download button. This minimises the chances that the user gets side tracked and won't follow through to the intended `exitURL`.

      To hide the download button you must specify an `exitURL` as well as `hidedownload`. The actual value of `hidedownload` does not matter for it to be active.

      Be aware that you have to offer the signed document as a download to the user in your application if you hide the download button on Skribble's interface.
  - name: 3. Download the signed PDF document
    description: |-
      Now we want to download the signed PDF document. The `SignatureRequest` that we created before contains the `document_id`.  
      The document ID is needed to download the document content or in other words to download the PDF document.

      We can get the `SignatureRequest` with `GET /v2/signature-requests/{SR_ID}`  
      You will find the document ID inside the field `document_id`.

      Finally, we can download the PDF document with a call to `GET /v2/documents/{DOC_ID}/content`.

      > **Note**  
      Documents on Skribble are **unchangeable** (immutable).  
      Changes to the document content, like a completed signature, always lead to a **NEW** document with a **NEW** ID. This means that the document ID you receive after uploading a document, will differ from the ID you receive after downloading the document once it is signed . 
        

      You can find ways to get notified about changes on the `SignatureRequest` in the chapter **Monitoring**.
  - name: Define the signers
    description: |-
      As mentioned in the **Quickstart** chapter, it is possible to specify the number of signers.  
      Please refer to that chapter for an example.

      The following special cases should be mentioned.

      1.  Add the **SAME signer** more than once.
      2.  **NO signer** initially
  - name: Define Visual Signatures
    description: |-
      The visual signature on a PDF document is an optional element that does not affect the legal validity of the electronic signature. The decision to add a visual signature is at the discretion of the inviter. Including a visual signature can maintain the appearance of a handwritten signature and provide additional information about the signer.

      If a signature request lacks specific instructions for a visual signature, the user can create and place a visual signature anywhere on the document using the [Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com). This flexibility mirrors how physical documents handle signature placement, where visual hints like "Please sign here" are helpful but not required.

      In the digital world, we have some more options.

      **Multiple visual signatures**

      Visual signatures can be placed multiple times within a document, similar to how one might need to sign in various locations on a physical document. The advantage of this approach is that the signatory only needs to sign once using the [ Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com). All visual signatures in the document are then linked to this single electronic signature.
  - name: Provide PDF file to sign
    description: The **Skribble API** supports different ways of providing the PDF document for signing.
  - name: Define the signature quality and legislation
    description: |-
      Skribble supports different levels of signature qualities – the so-called e-signature standards. For more information on when to use which e-signature standard, visit our [website](https://www.skribble.com/signaturestandards/).

      The selected signature quality for the document is determined by two parameters: `quality` and `legislation`.

      The parameter `quality` supports the following values:

      | Quality | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | **QES** | The document must be signed at QES, so every signer must use QES. This is the **default** quality. |
      | **AES** | The document should be signed at AES. Signers will use AES, if available, otherwise they fall back to QES, if available. |
      | **AES_MINIMAL** | The document will be signed at at least AES, but a higher level is preferred. Signers will sign QES, if available, otherwise they will use AES. |
      | **SES** | The document will be signed at SES by every signer. |
      | **DEMO** | The document will be signed with a DEMO signature by every signer.  <br>**Note:** This signature has **NO** legal binding at all.<br>**ALL** `SignatureRequests` that are created using an API demo user (*api_demo_example_xyz*) will get this quality by default. |

      > **Note**  
      > The qualities `QES` and `AES_MINIMAL` must provide a `legislation` parameter, because the QES is bound to legal regulations, which are different in Switzerland and the EU.

      The legislation parameter correspond to the following values:

      | Legislation | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | **ZERTES** | QES according to the Swiss law. This is the **default** legislation. |
      | **EIDAS** | QES according to the EU law. |
  - name: Signing without an account
    description: |-
      It is possible to create a `SignatureRequest` where one or more invited participants won't need a [Skribble](https://my.skribble.com) account to sign the `SignatureRequest`. Those signers are called _**No-Account-Signers (NAS)**_.

      To create a `SignatureRequest` for a user without an account, omit the `signatures` array entry for this user and provide the necessary data using the `signer_identity_data` element instead.

      | Field | Description | Mandatory |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | `email_address` | E-mail address of no account signer | yes (for quality SES) |
      | `mobile_number` | Mobile number of no account signer | no |
      | `first_name` | First name of no account signer | no |
      | `last_name` | Last name of no accounts signer | no |
      | `provider` | Evidence provider where Skribble can verify the signer's identity data. | no |
      | `language` | See **Language parameter** for more information. | no |

      Other settings can be provided as usual, e.g. callback URLs, documents and so on.

      Each entry in the `signatures` array will be treated as a distinct identity. This means two entries with the same `signer_identity_data` are treated as two different identities and require that this person signs the document twice.

      Optionally you can combine `signer_identity_data` and `account_email` in your requests. In this case, the system checks first if there is a Skribble account with the specified e-mail address. If one is found the existing Skribble user will be invited to sign the document. Otherwise, the specified user in `signer_identity_data` will be invited to sign.

      > 💡 Good to know  
      We recommend this approach of combining `signer_identity_data` and `account_email` if you are unsure whether the user has a Skribble account.  
      The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the SignatureRequest in the **To sign** section of their account on my.skribble.com.  
      Conversely, if you invite them using only `signer_identity_data`, the document will not appear in their Skribble account, even if they have an existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to access the document using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email. 
        

      When the user visits the URL provided in the field `signing_url` inside the signature element, he will be forwarded to a special preview page of the PDF document and can start the signature process as usual.

      Missing fields like first name and last name can easily be adjusted by the signer through the Skribble web client.

      > Please note that you do not mix up the `signing_url` inside the `signature` field with the `signing_url` on the top level of the response. This contains the default URL for users with a regular [Skribble](https://my.skribble.com) account . 
        

      ##### Language parameter

      ###### Browser view

      Skribble will display its content in the user's browser language by default. You can change the language by adding a `lang` parameter to the `signing_url` when calling the browser.

      > Example for a `lang` parameter  
      _my.skribble.com/view/some-id-000-00000/some-id-fff-fffff?lang=fr_ 
        

      ###### E-mail

      To determine in which language the e-mails are sent to the user, the parameter `language` can be added to `signer_identity_data`.

      ###### Supported languages

      Skribble supports the following languages:

      | Code | Language |
      | --- | --- |
      | en | English (default) |
      | de | German |
      | fr | French |
  - name: Define observers
    description: |-
      Skribble allows observers to be added to a `SignatureRequest`. Observers are given read access on the `SignatureRequest` and will be notified in the same way about activities on the `SignatureRequest` as a signer of the `SignatureRequest`.

      > **Note**  
      > The given observers need to have a valid Skribble account. Otherwise the email address will not be accepted as valid observer.
  - name: Disable notification e-mails
    description: Skribble takes over the communication with all participants of a `SignatrueRequest`, such as the creator or the different signers. It informs the respective participants by e-mail about changes in the status of the SR.These notifications are activated by default, but can be deactivated by a parameter.
  - name: Define automatic attachments
    description: |-
      When a `SignatureRequest` has been signed by all signers, all signers and all observers are notified by email.

      Skribble provides the option to attach two types of attachments automatically to this email:

      *   the signed document and
      *   the signature protocol.   

      This can be configured via the business settings, which can be used to define that these documents should generally be attached for all `SignatureRequests` created by business members.

      Alternatively it is possible to define the attachments on demand per `SignatureRequest` by using the `SignatureRequest` field `attach_on_success.`
  - name: Define a specific owner
    description: |-
      Generally, all `SignatureRequest` objects are created by an API user, who then typically becomes the owner of these objects.

      However, in some specific cases, you might want to designate a business member as the owner of a SignatureRequest. For instance, if you have an interface for one of your company applications, you may want the application user to become the owner of the `SignatureRequest` when they initiate a signing process.

      This is possible, but only if two conditions are met:

      1. The user designated as the new owner must have a **valid Skribble account.**
      2. The user designated as the new owner must be a **member of the same business** as the API user. External users cannot be made owners of a SignatureRequest.
          

      > 💡 Good to know  
      Even after changing the owner, the API user will remain a participant of the `SignatureRequest` object with read and write access. This allows the API user to continue performing actions such as modifying or retrieving the `SignatureRequest` object.
  - name: Define a signing sequence
    description: It may be the case that certain contracts or documents must be signed by the signatories in a certain sequence.
  - name: Disable TAN based NAS notifications for SES
    description: |-
      In combination with SES, Skribble offers a straightforward TAN-based validation for the email addresses of No-Account-Signers.

      This mechanism can be disabled by setting the field `notify` to `false` and additionally using the field `signer_identity_data.identity_reference` which can hold a customer generated value for further identtification.

      This means that No-Account-Signers can sign directly without needing the additional Skribble TAN process.

      This option enables you to either handle user identification themselves or to simply jump in as guarantee for your users.
  - name: Find
    description: |-
      #### Signature state

      A `SignatureRequest` as well as the single `Signatures` can be in different states.  
      The state of the `SignatureRequest` can be found in the field `status_overall`.  
      The single `Signatures` contains its state ind the field `signatures[].status_code`  
      The `SignatureRequest` and the `Signatures` can take one of the following states:

      | State | for Signature | for Signature Request |
      | --- | --- | --- |
      | **OPEN** | Waiting for the user to sign a signature. | At least one user has not signed or declined his/her signature yet. |
      | **DECLINED** | The user declined to sign. | At least one user declined to sign. The signature request failed. |
      | **WITHDRAWN** | The owner has withdrawn the signature request. | The owner has withdrawn the signature request. |
      | **SIGNED** | The user signed the document. | All users signed the document. The signature request was successfully completed. |
      | *ERROR* | A technical error occurred. | A technical error occurred. The signature request cannot be completed. |

      > **Note**  
      > The signature states are managed by the system. It has informal value and cannot be changed using the API.
  - name: Add or remove signers
    description: The Skribble API provides several methods for adding or removing signers from a SignatureRequest object. You can add or remove signers individually or update multiple signers simultaneously.
  - name: Add or remove attachments
    description: |-
      You may need to provide participants with additional information in the form of supplementary documents, such as Terms & Conditions or appendix documents.

      In this case, you can use the `attachment` endpoints to provide such documents through the `SignatureRequest` to the participants of the `SignatureRequest`.

      **Limits by content-type**

      The Skribble API accepts files of the type PDF, image files, Microsoft Office files and plain text types.

      Detailed list of the allowed `content_types`:

      - `application/pdf`
      - `application/x-tika-msoffice`
      - `application/x-tika-ooxml`
      - `application/msword`
      - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`
      - `application/vnd.ms-word.document.macroEnabled.12`
      - `application/vnd.ms-excel`
      - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`
      - `application/vnd.ms-excel.sheet.macroenabled.12`
      - `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint`
      - `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`
      - `application/vnd.ms-powerpoint.presentation.macroEnabled.12`
      - `image/gif`
      - `image/jpeg`
      - `image/png`
      - `test/plain`
          

      **Limits by content-size**

      The maximum size of one attachment file is equal to the the **maximum document size** of a PDF, which is about **40 MB**, which results in the maximum request size of 60 MB.

      **Limits by amount**

      Skribble currently does not limit the number of attachments per SignatureRequest. However, if we observe abuse of this service, we will take appropriate measures.

  - name: Create
    description: |-
      Uploading and affixing an electronic seal to a document takes just one call using the `/v2/seal` resource.

      The JSON is similar to the `SignatureRequest`. It requires only the PDF document as a Base64 encoded string in the content field.

      Additionally, you can place a visual signature on the document, as described in the [Visual Signatures](#cb71da67-1dbe-43a6-b74f-405935d88746) chapter of the Skribble API documentation, but this is optional.

      An API response from a seal request contains a `document_id` of the newly created document with the seal.

      Use the `GET /v2/documents` resource to retrieve the document with the electronic seal or reuse it in further signature requests, such as for personal electronic signatures.
  - name: User

  - name: Report
    description: Activities provide detailled signature usage information for your business.
  - name: Callbacks
    description: |-
      The easiest way to get the correct document ID after signing, is to use _success_, _update_ and _failure_ callbacks. These callbacks are triggered as soon as one of the mentioned events takes place.

      ##### Set callbacks

      To use these callbacks, the corresponding URL that should be called on one of the events, can be added to the `SignatureRequest` in one of these fields

      | Field | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `callback_success_url` | Is triggered when the document has been successfully signed by all parties involved. |
      | `callback_update_url` | Is triggered on changes on the `SignatureRequest` object like when one person of all involved parties has signed. |
      | `callback_error_url` | Is triggered when a person declines the signature or when the `SignatureRequest` is withdrawn. |

      > 💡 Good to know  
      Callback URLs will be called using a _POST_ request.  
      Callback URLs will be HTML encoded for the request. So please ensure, that your URL does not contain already encoded characters. 
        

      The callback URLs may contain placeholders, which are replaced with the current `SignatureRequest` data before the URL is called.

      | Placeholder | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | `SKRIBBLE_SIGNATURE_REQUEST_ID` | Will be replaced with the `SignatureRequest` ID, which triggers the callback. |
      | `SKRIBBLE_DOCUMENT_ID` | Will be replaced with the most recent or final document ID, which belongs to the triggering `SignatureRequest`. |
      | `SKRIBBLE_SIGNATURE_ID` | Only after a successful signature, so only for `callback_update_url`, this will be replaced with the Signature ID `SID` of the signature just made. |

      So, if the success callback triggers, the URL contains the correct document ID, which can then be used to retrieve the document.

      ##### TLS Mutual Authentication

      Callbacks support TLS mutual authentication (mTLS). If the callback endpoint (your side) asks for a client authentication during the TLS handshake, Skribble will authenticate itself with a [X.509 certificate for <i>api.skribble.com.</i>](https://www.skribble.com/ext/api/certificates/api.skribble.com.cer)  
      The callback will additionally send the related [root certificate from Globalsign](https://www.skribble.com/ext/api/certificates/GlobalSign_Root_CA.cer) as certificate authority as well as the related [intermediate certificate by Alpha SSL](https://www.skribble.com/ext/api/certificates/AlphaSSL_CA.cer) as certificate provider.

      ##### Retrials

      _Default:_ If a callback does not respond immediately, e.g. due to a **system downtime** on the callback url server (your side), Skribble will retry to call to the callback url every **10 minutes for two hours**. After this, Skribble will stop its efforts to contact the callback endpoint.

      _Retry-After:_ A callback response may contains a `Retry-After` header. With this value your system does informs Skribble API to pause retry attempts calling the callback URL until this pause time in seconds expires.

      summary: Login as user "api_demo_your_name"
      description: |-
        To obtain an access token, log in using the `/access/login` resource.

        You can pass your login data using raw JSON or alternatively as `x-www-form-urlencoded` `key:value` pairs(see example requests).

        Upon a successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) will be returned (see `{{AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN}}`).  
        The JWT MUST be included in nearly every request made to the API.

        The access token is transported in an HTTP header called `Authorization`.

        The content of the header starts with `Bearer` followed by the JWT string.

        Example: `Authorization: {{vault:bearer-token}}`

        #### Token Life Cycle

        * * *

        ##### API-Key

        The API key has a long, but not an unlimited lifetime.

        The validity period should depend on the volume of API calls and will be discussed individually for each customer as part of the shared secret agreement.

        ##### Access Token

        The access token has a lifetime of about **20 minutes**.  
        Currently, we do not renew the access token automatically. But this is planned for future releases.

        ##### Logout

        There is **no logout**. The access token will expire after the defined time.

      summary: List and find SignatureRequests
      description: |-
        Using this `GET` request, you can list all the `SignatureRequests` provided that the current user has sufficient access rights to.

        You can optionally filter these `SignatureRequests` using one or more of the following criteria.

        | Parameter | Description | Mandatory |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | **account_email** | Filter on the field `signatures[].account_email` | no |
        | **search** | Filter on the field `title` to search for documents _**containing**_ the serach term. | no |
        | **signature_status** | Filter on the field `signatures[].status_code` with one of the valid **Signature states** | no |
        | **status_overall** | Filter on the field `status_overall` with one of the valid **Signature states** | no |

        > **Note**  
        The filter searches for an exact match of the corresponding field content. This means that the filter is case sensitive and won&apos;t find objects that only _contain_ the parameter. For example _account_email=john.doe@skribble.com_ will only find a `SignatureRequests` where the field `account_email` is exactly [&lt;em&gt;john.doe@skribble.com&lt;/em&gt;](https://mailto:john.doe@skribble.com). It won&apos;t find [&lt;em&gt;another.john.doe@skribble.com&lt;/em&gt;](https://mailto:another.john.doe@skribble.com)  
        Exception: The search parameter searches for document titles that contain the search term. 
          

        **Pagination**

        Furthermore, the result set can be controlled using the optional pagination parameters `page_number` and `page_size`, which helps prevent excessively large result sets.

        | Parameter | Description | Mandatory |
        | --- | --- | --- |
        | `page_number` | Page number must be greater than or equal to 0  <br>Default: Pagination is disabled | no |
        | `page_size` | Page size must be greater than or equal to 0  <br>Default: 50 | no |

        To add or remove multiple signers at once, you need to update the `signatures` array according to your needs.

        - To add a signer to the `SignatureRequest`, simply add a new entry to the signatures array.
            
        - To remove a signer from the `SignatureRequest`, simply remove the corresponding entry from the `signatures` array.
            

        > ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTE** 
          

        - Please be aware that if you want to add one or more new signers, you MUST include the existing signers in the update request. Any signers not present in the `signatures` array will be removed!
            
        - Changes to the signatures can only be made as long as none of the signers have already completed the signature.

      summary: Delete a signature request
      description: |-
        By using the signature request ID you can delete a `SignatureRequest`.  
         
        **Important:** A `SignatureRequest` can only be deleted using the API, if:
        1. the `SignatureRequest` is in the `status_overall=OPEN` and
        2. the API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, eg. when it was created by the API user. 
          
        Deleting a `SignatureRequest` does not necessarily remove the `SignatureRequest` from the system. 
         
        **WITHDRAWN**  
        When the API user is the **owner** of the `SignatureRequest` and the `SignatureRequest` is still in the `status_overall=OPEN` then the `SignatureRequest` will be **WITHDRAWN**.  
        This means that the `SignatureRequest` will get `status_overall=WITHDRAWN` and all the invited signatures will be marked with `status_code=WITHDRAWN`. Sign and read rights for the signers will be removed from the `SignatureRequest`, so that the invited signers can neither read nor sign the `SignatureRequest` any more. 

        **REMOVE AS PARTICIPANT**  
        When the API user is NOT the owner of the document but a participant of the `SignatureRequest`, then the `DELETE` request will only remove the current API user as participant from the signature request. 
        In this case the system will remove the objects the `SignatureRequest` and the related `document` as soon as the last remaining user deletes the `SignatureRequest` using the [Skribble web application](https://my.skribble.com) 

        **DELETING**  
        When the API user is the last user with access rights to the `SignatureRequest` e.g. after a **WITHDRAW** request, then the `SignatureRequest` and the related `document` will be completely removed from the system.

        Deleting a `Document` is similar to deleting a `SignatureRequest`.  
        That means, deleting a `Document`  does not necessarily remove the a `Document` from the system.  

        If there is MORE than one participant involved, then the DELETE request will only remove the current user from the `Document`.   

        Only when the lat user deletes the `Document` using the Skribble web application, the system  will finally remove the object.

      summary: Add an individual signer
      description: |-
        To add an individual signer, use the same parameters as when creating a SignatureRequest. The process is the same. By using `account_email`, you can add a signer who has a Skribble account. By using `signer_identity_data`, you can invite a No-Account-Signer to the SignatureRequest with the ID `{{SR_ID}}`.

        > 💡 Good to know  
        We recommend this approach of combining `signer_idendity_data` and `account_email` if you are unsure whether the user has a Skribble account. The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the SignatureRequest in the **To sign** section of their account on my.skribble.com.  
        Conversely, if you invite them using only `signer_identity_data`, the document will not appear in their Skribble account, even if they have an existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to access the document using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email.

      summary: Withdraw a signature request
      description: |-
        Sometimes, signing a document may become unnecessary, or errors might occur during the invitation process. As the inviter of such a `SignatureRequest`, you can _explicitely_ `withdraw` the `SignatureRequest`. Withdraw removes all signatories and observers from the document as participants and notifies them with a specified `message.`

        Similar to `deletion`, the `withdraw` action can only be executed if:

        - The SignatureRequest status is `status_overall=OPEN`
        - The API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, such as when it was created by the API user.
            

        > **Note**  
        We recommend using the `delete` endpoint. By default, it checks for other options. For example, if the API user does not have withdrawal rights, the user could be removed from the `SignatureRequest` directly, or the document might be deleted directly.  
        Nevertheless, there may be situations in which you need to withdraw the document and keep it in Skribble. In this case you should of course use the `withdraw` functionality.

        In addition to the automatic signature reminders, manual reminders can also be initiated via the Skribble web application and also via the API.

        This allows for greater flexibility in managing signature requests, ensuring that important documents are signed promptly. By using both automatic and manual reminders, you can tailor your approach to suit the specific needs of your users or customers.

        **Limits**

        There is an hourly limit on the number of signature reminders that can be sent. This limit ensures that reminders are used responsibly and prevents excessive notifications. Generally, this restriction should not affect you if you use this feature appropriately. By adhering to this limit, you can effectively manage your signature requests without overwhelming your users or customers with frequent reminders.

        If you create a SignatureRequest with quality=AES_MINIMAL and the legislation=ZERTES the user in this example would finally sign the document with the signature quality QES.  
        As described in the previous chapter AES_MINIMAL will use QES as long as the user settings allow this.

      summary: Get a user's signature qualities (simple)
      description: We recommend using the `signature-qualities-details` endpoint to request detailed signature quality information for a user. This endpoint provides comprehensive data about the quality of the signature. However, for compatibility reasons, we continue to offer the previous endpoint, which delivers a simplified result set. This ensures that users of the older version of our API can still access essential signature quality information without needing to upgrade immediately.

      summary: Get the list of callbacks for a signature request
      description: |-
        In certain scenarios, it is beneficial to view and verify the status of callbacks for a `SignatureRequest`. For example, you might want to confirm whether a callback has already been executed or to identify any errors that occurred during the callback process.

        This endpoint provides the capability to obtain detailed information about the callbacks associated with a `SignatureRequest`, enabling comprehensive monitoring and troubleshooting. By using this endpoint, you can ensure the reliability and accuracy of your callback operations and quickly address any issues that may arise.

        **Result**

        If no callback has been called yet, the response will be an empty array. Otherwise it will contain an array of `callback` objects that were already executed.

        The fields description of the single callback object:

        | **Fieldname** | **Description** |
        | --- | --- |
        | `signature_request_id` | The ID of the parent `SignatureRequest` object. |
        | `url` | The given URL to which the callback request will be sent. |
