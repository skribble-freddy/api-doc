  summary: Withdraw a signature request
  description: |-
    Sometimes, signing a document may become unnecessary, or errors might occur
    during the invitation process. As the inviter of such a `SignatureRequest`,
    you can _explicitely_ `withdraw` the `SignatureRequest`. Withdraw removes
    all signatories and observers from the document as participants and notifies
    them with a specified `message.`


    Similar to `deletion`, the `withdraw` action can only be executed if:


    - The SignatureRequest status is `status_overall=OPEN`

    - The API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, such as when
    it was created by the API user.
        

    > **Note**  

    We recommend using the `delete` endpoint. By default, it checks for other
    options. For example, if the API user does not have withdrawal rights, the
    user could be removed from the `SignatureRequest` directly, or the document
    might be deleted directly.  

    Nevertheless, there may be situations in which you need to withdraw the
    document and keep it in Skribble. In this case you should of course use the
    `withdraw` functionality.
