  summary: Get signature qualities details for a user
  description: |-
    The result of this query will tell you what final signature `quality` will be
    used for the given user `username` to sign a document.  

    The resulting signature quality is determined in combination of the
    requested `quality` and `legislation`, whereas any stands for any legislation.  

    Description for the example request:  

    If you create a `SignatureRequest` with `quality=AES_MINIMAL` and the
    `legislation=ZERTES` the user in this example would finally sign the document
    with the signature quality `QES`.  

    As described in the previous chapter `AES_MINIMAL` will use `QES` as long as the
    user settings allow this.
