    The Skribble API v3 documentation describes the publicly available Skribble
    API version 3. The API allows businesses and teams of any size to integrate
    the e-signing solution of Skribble with internal systems, software, or SaaS
    solutions. It provides a simple interface to create and manage signature
    requests programmatically. Signature requests define who signs what and
    describe the document flow between participants. Actual signing occurs in
    the Skribble web application.

        In order to use the API of Skribble, you first need to obtain an API key
        with an API user. Both can be accessed inside the API key page inside your
        business profile. From here, you can create and manage your API keys.
        Consult our [guide](https://docs.skribble.com/business-admin/api/apicreate.html) for help.


        Skribble offers two types of API keys:


        **Demo API keys**  

        Demo API keys are for testing and development purposes.
        Signatures requested by such keys don't have any legal weight and are free
        of charge.

        You can recognize these keys by their name, which start with **api_demo**.  


        **Production API keys**  

        Production API keys are used for live systems.
        Signatures requested by such keys will be invoiced.  

        You can recognize these keys by their name, which usually starts with
        **api_production** or in some rare cases just with **api_prod**.

        > **⚠ Note**  
        All costs of signature requests created with your API keys will be
        **charged to your business**! 
              
        We recommend you to **start with a demo API key for development and
        testing** and switch to the production API key as soon as you are finished
        with testing.

        If you have problems setting up Skribble Business, just drop us an e-mail
        at [info@skribble.com](mailto:info@skribble.com).


        To obtain an access token, log in using the `/access/login` resource.

        You can pass your login data using raw JSON or alternatively as
        `x-www-form-urlencoded` `key:value` pairs (see example requests).

        Upon a successful login, a JSON Web Token (JWT) will be returned.  
        The JWT MUST be included in nearly every request made to the API.


        The access token is transported in an HTTP header called `Authorization`.

        The content of the header starts with `Bearer` followed by the JWT string.
        Example: `Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI...`

        ### Token Life Cycle

        #### API-Key

        The API key has a long, but not an unlimited lifetime.  
        The validity period depends on the volume of API calls and is discussed individually as part of the shared secret agreement.

        #### Access Token

        The access token has a lifetime of about **20 minutes**.  
        Currently, we do not renew the access token automatically. Planned for future releases.

        #### Logout

        There is **no logout**. The access token will expire after the defined time.

      summary: Create a Signature Request
      description: |-
        The `SignatureRequest` object is the primary object of the Skribble API .
        It describes who signs what and how. It gives an overview of the current state 
        of the single Signatures and allows to control user rights or callback functionality.

        Compared to the previous API version, one major improvement is the ability to include
        multiple documents when creating a `SignatureRequest`.

        Another significant change is that the request no longer triggers invitations immediately.
        Instead, the `SignatureRequest` is created with an status_overall value of DRAFT.

        If you specify an owner for the `SignatureRequest` using the creator field, that user will see
        it appear in the new Drafts section. From there, they can continue the process and complete
        the invitation steps.

        When everything is ready, don't forget to call `/initiate` to start the `SignatureRequest`

        Using this `GET` request, you can list all the `SignatureRequest` provided
        that the current user has sufficient access rights to.


        **Filter**


        You can optionally filter these `SignatureRequest` using one or more of the
        optional parameters.  


        The filter searches for an exact match of the corresponding field
        content. This means that the filter is case sensitive and find objects
        that only _contain_ the parameter. For example _account_email=john.doe@skribble.com_ 
        will only find a `SignatureRequest` where the field `account_email` is exactly
        john.doe@skribble.com and it won't find another.john.doe@skribble.com


        Exception: The search parameter searches for document titles that contain
        the search term. 


        **Pagination** 


        Furthermore, the result set can be controlled using the optional pagination
        parameters `page_number` and `page_size`, which helps prevent excessively
        large result sets.

        Modifications on existing `SignatureRequest` should be handled with care.
        We recommend creating the `SignatureRequest` with all necessary information. 


        To add or remove multiple signers at once, you need to update the
        `signatures` array according to your needs.

        - To add a signer to the `SignatureRequest`, simply add a new entry to the
        signatures array.
            
        - To remove a signer from the `SignatureRequest`, simply remove the
        corresponding entry from the `signatures` array.
            

        > **IMPORTANT NOTE** 
          

        - Please be aware that if you want to add one or more new signers, you MUST
        include the existing signers in the update request. Any signers not present
        in the `signatures` array will be removed!
            
        - Changes to the signatures can only be made as long as none of the signers
        have already completed the signature.

      summary: Delete a Signature Request
      description: |-
        By using the signature request ID you can delete a `SignatureRequest`.  
         
        **Important:** A `SignatureRequest` can only be deleted using the API, if:

        1. the `SignatureRequest` is in the `status_overall=OPEN` and

        2. the API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, eg. when it
        was created by the API user. 
          
        Deleting a `SignatureRequest` does not necessarily remove the
        `SignatureRequest` from the system. 
         
        **WITHDRAWN**  

        When the API user is the **owner** of the `SignatureRequest` and the
        `SignatureRequest` is still in the `status_overall=OPEN` then the
        `SignatureRequest` will be **WITHDRAWN**.  

        This means that the `SignatureRequest` will get `status_overall=WITHDRAWN`
        and all the invited signatures will be marked with `status_code=WITHDRAWN`.
        Sign and read rights for the signers will be removed from the
        `SignatureRequest`, so that the invited signers can neither read nor sign
        the `SignatureRequest` any more. 


        **REMOVE AS PARTICIPANT**  

        When the API user is NOT the owner of the document but a participant of the
        `SignatureRequest`, then the `DELETE` request will only remove the current
        API user as participant from the signature request. 

        In this case the system will remove the objects the `SignatureRequest` and
        the related `document` as soon as the last remaining user deletes the
        `SignatureRequest` using the [Skribble web
        application](https://my.skribble.com) 


        **DELETING**  

        When the API user is the last user with access rights to the
        `SignatureRequest` e.g. after a **WITHDRAW** request, then the
        `SignatureRequest` and the related `document` will be completely removed
        from the system.

      summary: Withdraw a signature request
      description: |-
        Sometimes, signing a document may become unnecessary, or errors might occur
        during the invitation process. As the inviter of such a `SignatureRequest`,
        you can _explicitely_ `withdraw` the `SignatureRequest`. Withdraw removes
        all signatories and observers from the document as participants and notifies
        them with a specified `message.`


        Similar to `deletion`, the `withdraw` action can only be executed if:


        - The SignatureRequest status is `status_overall=OPEN`

        - The API user has sufficient rights on the `SignatureRequest`, such as when
        it was created by the API user.
            

        > **Note**  

        We recommend using the `delete` endpoint. By default, it checks for other
        options. For example, if the API user does not have withdrawal rights, the
        user could be removed from the `SignatureRequest` directly, or the document
        might be deleted directly.  

        Nevertheless, there may be situations in which you need to withdraw the
        document and keep it in Skribble. In this case you should of course use the
        `withdraw` functionality.

      summary: Remind open signers of a signature request
      description: |-
        In addition to the automatic signature reminders, manual reminders can also
        be initiated via the Skribble web application and also via the API.


        This allows for greater flexibility in managing signature requests, ensuring
        that important documents are signed promptly. By using both automatic and
        manual reminders, you can tailor your approach to suit the specific needs of
        your users or customers.


        **Limits**


        There is an hourly limit on the number of signature reminders that can be
        sent. This limit ensures that reminders are used responsibly and prevents
        excessive notifications. Generally, this restriction should not affect you
        if you use this feature appropriately. By adhering to this limit, you can
        effectively manage your signature requests without overwhelming your users
        or customers with frequent reminders.

        PDF document. Optionally, the report format can be changed using the
        `type` query parameter (e.g. JSON or HTML).

        The report contains all relevant information about the signature process,

        In certain scenarios, it is beneficial to view and verify the status of
        callbacks for a `SignatureRequest`. For example, you might want to confirm
        whether a callback has already been executed or to identify any errors that
        occurred during the callback process.


        This endpoint provides the capability to obtain detailed information about
        the callbacks associated with a `SignatureRequest`, enabling comprehensive
        monitoring and troubleshooting. By using this endpoint, you can ensure the
        reliability and accuracy of your callback operations and quickly address any
        issues that may arise.


        **Result**


        If no callback has been called yet, the response will be an empty array.
        Otherwise it will contain an array of `callback` objects that were already
        executed.

      summary: Add an individual signer
      description: |-
        To add an individual signer, use the same parameters as when creating a
        SignatureRequest. The process is the same. By using `account_email`, you can
        add a signer who has a Skribble account. By using `signer_identity_data`,
        you can invite a No-Account-Signer to the SignatureRequest with the ID
        `{{SR_ID}}`.


        > 💡 Good to know  

        We recommend this approach of combining `signer_idendity_data` and
        `account_email` if you are unsure whether the user has a Skribble account.
        The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the
        SignatureRequest in the **To sign** section of their account on
        my.skribble.com.  

        Conversely, if you invite them using only `signer_identity_data`, the
        document will not appear in their Skribble account, even if they have an
        existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to access the document
        using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email.

        Deleting a `Document` is similar to deleting a `SignatureRequest`.  

        That means, deleting a `Document`  does not necessarily remove the a
        `Document` from the system.  


        If there is MORE than one participant involved, then the DELETE request will
        only remove the current user from the `Document`.   


        Only when the last user deletes the `Document` using the Skribble web
        application, the system  will finally remove the object.

        This can be configured via the business settings, which can be used to define that these documents should generally

                List of recipients required to sign the document.

                It is possible to create a SignatureRequest where one or more invited participants won't need a 
                Skribble account to sign the SignatureRequest. Those signers are called No-Account-Signers (NAS).

                To create a SignatureRequest for a user without an account, omit the signatures array entry for
                this user and provide the necessary data using the `signer_identity_data` element instead.

                Each entry in the signatures array will be treated as a distinct identity. This means two entries 
                with the same `signer_identity_data` are treated as two different identities and require that this 
                person signs the document twice.

                Optionally you can combine `signer_identity_data` and account_email in your requests. In this case, 
                the system checks first if there is a Skribble account with the specified e-mail address. 
                If one is found the existing Skribble user will be invited to sign the document. Otherwise, the 
                specified user in `signer_identity_data` will be invited to sign.

                > Good to know
                We recommend this approach of combining `signer_identity_data` and `account_email` if you are unsure 
                whether the user has a Skribble account.
                The benefit is that an existing Skribble user will afterwards find the SignatureRequest in the 
                To sign section of their account on my.skribble.com.
                Conversely, if you invite them using only signer_identity_data, the document will not appear in
                their Skribble account, even if they have an existing Skribble account. Instead, they will have to
                access the document using the specific link provided in their signature invitation email. 

                When the user visits the URL provided in the field `signing_url` inside the signature element, he
                will be forwarded to a special preview page of the PDF document and can start the signature process
                as usual.

                Missing fields like first name and last name can easily be adjusted by the signer through the
                Skribble web client.
